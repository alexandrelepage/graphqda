	<p>GraphQDA is a qualitative data analysis software aiming at ease the task of transcription and analysis. It has been developed for speech transcription and analysis, though you may find other uses.</p>
	
	<p>It is currently released as a <strong>prototype</strong> to better fit my needs as I am completing a Master's degree in instructional technology at Université Laval, Québec. That means that although you may find it interesting, it is not ready for production uses (unless you want to jump into the code). I was not satisfied with payful softwares. I won't name any, but if you feel like innovation in QDA softwares have been stopped in the early 2000's, we are probably talking about the sames.</p>
	
	<p>Basically, GraphQDA is a collection of javascript libraries that stores everything as JSON so that you can reuse all your data with your own scripts. The key feature is the ability to display data in graphs (thanks to the vis.js library for that). It is almost the same as what a lot of qualitative researchers still accomplish with post-its on a wall (seriously).</p>
